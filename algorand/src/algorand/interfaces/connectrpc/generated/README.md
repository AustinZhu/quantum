Generated protobuf and ConnectRPC Python files are emitted here by:

`../scripts/generate_proto.sh` (runs `buf generate` from the `algorand` service module)

Current scaffold keeps this directory under source control for stable import paths,
but generated files are intentionally omitted until codegen runs.
