Generated protobuf and ConnectRPC Python files are emitted here by:

`../scripts/generate_proto.sh` (delegates to monorepo `api/scripts/generate.sh`)

Current scaffold keeps this directory under source control for stable import paths,
but generated files are intentionally omitted until codegen runs.
